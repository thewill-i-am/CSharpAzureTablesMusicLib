This repository contains a monolithic project that creates a virtual library for uploading music to a document-based database, specifically Azure Tables. The project is built using C#, Azure Tables, and React, and follows a clean architecture design pattern. The codebase includes implementations of Azure Tables and React front-end, and provides functionality to store and retrieve music data. The project has been designed to be scalable and modular, allowing for easy integration with other systems. This repository is intended to serve as a reference point for anyone looking to build a document-based music library using Azure Tables, and also as a proof of concept for building a monolithic project with a clean architecture design.
